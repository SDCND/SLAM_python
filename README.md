# SLAM_python

This is the my python code solution for the **SLAM python course given by Claus Brenner**.

This course has a link to the videos on YouTube. There are totally 77 videos with 7 Units. This course is a good choice for slam beginners. "It covers developing a robot motion model, Bayes filtering with Histogram Filter, Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter, and Particle Filter.  The material is centered around data gathered from a Lego based tracked robot with a laser scanner in an arena with cylindrical markers. Programming assignments are in Python". [Introductory SLAM Course - Google Groups] [1]

My codes are implemented in python3. I merge all Units into one folder. All codes are in this `src` folder, with generated files.


## Origin code (in python2)
